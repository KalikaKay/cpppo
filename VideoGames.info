In my drunken state, I feel the need to remind myself what I'm up to with this.

First of all - I forked this application because I have an extensive knowledge and interest in telecommunications. Specifically TRS.
Thirteen years worth of knowledge in this industry has me obsessed/primarily focused on telecom routing, handling, processing, etc. 
Experience includes PIKA and Digi - from client to client - . I love the to. 

I fancy the Rockwell - not today's rockwell I just know yesterday's Rockwell and knowing she's still around and has software
(my experience is merely with the hardwaree) well I HAVE to fondle her.

Next up: I dig the name- I mean HOW CAN I NOT PLAY WITH A C3PO APPLICATION??!!!??? the only thing I like about Star Wars is the AI.

Next: I see Semantics in it. I don't know for sure how or why, but I see the Semantics and it makes me grin. I know she never got far
https://stanbol.apache.org/, but I don't care. 

I see a call center/data center emulation utility. Something to help you figure out what needs to be parsed where and
tells you how to do the parsing.

I might be wrong - but .. .. .. fuck it I want to play so I'm going to play.

NetBSD is chosen cuz... because... CUZ... BE.. cause... BEEEEE CCCAAUUUSES.. i kind of see a possibility for an operating system...
and I just want to make this work with the bare necessities so I can put it anywhere I want.
